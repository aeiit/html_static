            Developing a staic web page is one of the easiest skills to learn. All you really need to learn is basic HTML and if you want to add some styling to further enhance the page then you'd have to learn CSS. Howeve, in this current day and age a static web page is almost outdated and most developers must learn how to upgrade a staic web page to become more dynamic. In order to do this, the basic skill set of HTML and CSS will serve as a foundation but more skill set needs to be learnt.
